# COMP6248-Colab-Worksheets
Module COMP6248 Deep Learning, University of Southampton

These worksheets have been designed to put the theory covered in the lectures into context, and the equip you with practical skills in implementing and training differentiable programs. 

To work through these labs youâ€™ll use the Python 3 language in a Jupyter Notebook environment, with the pytorch tensor library. We will primarily be using Google Colab to run the notebooks as this gives you access to an environment with all the tools required.
